This program requires the game of Wordle to be open alongside the code while it is running.
After running the bot, try not to click on anything else except for the browser window that is playing wordle.

Using elementary probabilty theory, we are able to rank every possible guess based on the amount of information it 
would provide us (you may have seen this on 3blue1brown's youtube video on the subject of the "Best first guess")
From there, the bot is able to narrow down to the correct answer.

Sidenote: There are times where the New York Times will remove a word from the list of allowed guesses. In
those cases, I will need to remove them from the bot's text file to prevent any hiccups.
